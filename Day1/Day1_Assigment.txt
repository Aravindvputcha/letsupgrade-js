Question 1 :
Explore and explain the various methods in console function
Explain them
Ex. console.log()

Assignment :

            console.log(): For output of logging information
            console.error(): to print errors on console
            console.warn(): to print warnings on web page
            console.clear(): to clear content on console.
            console.time(): to print start time
            console.timeend(): to print the ned time of loop
            console.timelog() :to print the log time
            console.exception(): to print exception on console.
            console.table(): to print output in form of table
            console.info(): to print some output on console



Question2:
Difference between var let and const:

                Var: 
                    its used to define variable in java script 
                    Scope of var:  var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
                    It can be easily edited or altered

                    eg:     var namaste = "hey hi";
                        var times = 4;

                        if (times > 3) {
                            var namaste = "say Hello instead"; 
                        }
                        
                        console.log(namaste) // "say Hello instead"

                Let:
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.
                    So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. 

                    eg:
                    let namaste = "say Hi";
                    let times = 4;

                    if (times > 3) {
                            let hello = "say Hello instead";
                            console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
                        }
                    console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

                    let is new and better way of initialising variables to reduce ambiquity while writing code.

                    Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. 

                const:
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values, value once declared cant be updated / redeclared
                    we need to assign value as when declared.

                    const greeting = "say Hi";
                    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. 


Question 3 :
Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript

                available data types in java script:

                Six Data Types that are primitives,
                                undefined 
                                Boolean 
                                Number 
                                String 
                                BigInt 
                                Symbol 
                null : "object". Special primitive type having additional usage for it's value: if object is not inherited, then null is shown;
                Object  "object".  object instance also used as data structures: new Object
                Function non data structure,  "function".
